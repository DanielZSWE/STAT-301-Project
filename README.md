# STAT-301-Project

Project for the course **STAT 301: Statistical Modelling for Data Science** at UBC. 

In this project, we predict the Metacritic score of Steam games (the response variable) released after the year 1970, based on input variables such as the price, the number of recommendations, and release date of a game. Additive linear regression, forward selection, and lambda selection techniques are applied. 

Please see the file **stat-301_final_report.ipynb** for the finished project.
